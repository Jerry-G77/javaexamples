Code Shown on the Slides
========================

This directory contains code used during the class lecture or contained in the slides.

For Lecture 00 only, we have some C, C++, and Python code as well as Java code. Type ``make`` at the bash command line for your options to build and run these programs. 

You'll need Python 3 and the Gnu Compiler Collection (gcc, g++) for the non-Java programs. 

* If missing from Linux, install both using ``sudo apt install python3 build-essential`` 

* For other operating systems, see https://www.python.org/downloads/ and https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html for guidance.

## Java Source Code

As always, ``javac Hello.java`` or ``ant`` will build and ``java Hello`` will run the Java program (assuming that Hello.java includes ``public static void main(String[] args)``, of course).

If on Linux you get e.g., ``Command 'javac' not found, but can be installed with:``, execute the recommended command that follows.

I recommend Java 17 or OpenJDK 17 for this class.
