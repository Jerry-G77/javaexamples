Lecture 06
==========

String Buffer vs String
-----------------------

This file enables you to time the use of Java's StringBuffer vs String for whatever operations you'd like to define, calculating which is faster and by what percentage. By default, it reverses a 1000-character String.

ArrayList vs Array
------------------

This demo compares classic C-like arrays to Java's ArrayList class.

StackExplorer
-------------

For this semester only (limited time!), this program helps you to visualize how the Stack class works. (Later, we'll meet ArrayDeque, or the Array Double-Ended Queue, which is a much more comprehensive class for implementing stacks. For now, though, since Stack is easier to use, we'll use it for P03.)

Class Relationships
-------------------

This UML class diagram and simple Java implementation demonstrate the key relationships between classes that we discussed in lecture.

The UML diagram is provided in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Portable Network Graphics (PNG) formats, as well as PlantUML code.

The UML diagram specified in class.uml and shown in class.png and class.svg may be found on-line at the following URL. You may edit the [PlantUML code] online and click Submit to edit the diagram.
